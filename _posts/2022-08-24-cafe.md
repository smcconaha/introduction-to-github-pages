Today I learned a ***LOT*** more about GitHub.  I am currently working through the pages tutorial and how to create a blog post.  I have included a list below of some of the other things I have learned.
- How to create a commit
- How to intiate a pull-request
- How to merge the pull-request.  Essentially combining one branch (feature) with the main (master) branch
- How to use markdown language
- How to create a task list
