**Cafe Saturday!** My wife and I have a habit of going to one of a handful of coffee shops every Saturday.  We ***REALLY*** prefer to visit cafes that have pastries but a good espresso machine is really all that's needed.  I have included a list of some our favorites below, enjoy!

- Manchester Coffee Company
- Brevede
- Old School Coffee
